####What does it do?
*CitibikeBetter is a map to help citibikers get around New York. It provides automatic station-to-station biking directions based on street addresses.*

Search for directions the same way you would on Google Maps. Click on the 'Current Location' link to use that as your starting point. You will be shown biking directions from the closest station to your origin with bikes available to the closest station to your destination with open docks.

The homepage should find your current location automatically. Press Find Staitons to see a dropdown menu of nearby stations, represented on the map by orange markers. Click on a station to see its current bike/dock status. You can also store your favorite places, e.g., Home, to get quick directions to a specific address from your current location with one click.
