CitibikeBetter is a map to better help citibikers get around New York.

Search for directions the same way you would on Google Maps. You will be shown biking directions from the closest station to your origin with bikes available to the closest station to your destination with open docks.

The homepage should find your current location automatically. Press Find Staitons to see a dropdown menu of nearby stations, represented on the map by orange markes. Click on a station to see its current bike/dock status.

You can also store your favorite places, e.g., Home, to get quick directions to a specific address from your current location.
